# nfcamp 2019 speakers

Nextflow Camp brings together the Nextflow community of developers and users to discuss the state of Nextflow technology, the latest developments and tackle the open questions in a collaborative manner. Each day is split between talks from Nextflow experts and tutorial breakout sessions where participants get a flavour for the possibilities for their own applications.
