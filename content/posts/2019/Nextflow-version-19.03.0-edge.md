It's time for the monthly Nextflow release for March, edge version 19.03. This is another great release with some cool new features, bug fixes and improvements.


### SRA channel factory
This sees the introduction of the long-awaited sequence read archive (SRA) channel factory.
The SRA is a key public repository for sequencing data and run in coordination between The National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI), The European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ).

This feature originates all the way back in [2015](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow/issues/89) and was worked on during a 2018 Nextflow hackathon. It was brought to fore again with the release of Phil Ewels [SRA Explorer](https://ewels.github.io/sra-explorer/). The SRA channel factory allows users to pull read data in FASTQ format directly from SRA by referencing a study, accession ID or even a keyword. It works in a similar way to [`fromFilePairs`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html#fromfilepairs), returning a sample id and files (or pairs of files) for each sample.

The code snippet below creates a channel containing 24 samples from a chromatin dynamics study and runs FASTQC on the resulting files.

{{< highlight groovy "linenos=table" >}}

Channel
    .fromSRA('SRP043510')
    .set {reads}

process fastqc {
    input:
    set sample_id, file(reads_file) from reads

    output:
    file("fastqc_${sample_id}_logs") into fastqc_ch

    script:
    """
    mkdir fastqc_${sample_id}_logs
    fastqc -o fastqc_${sample_id}_logs -f fastq -q ${reads_file}
    """
}

See the [documentation](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/edge/channel.html#fromsra) for more details. When combined with downstream processes, you can quickly open a firehose of data on your workflow!

### Edge release
Note that this is a monthly edge release. To use it simply execute the following command prior to running Nextflow:

{{< highlight bash  >}}
$ export NXF_VER=19.03.0-edge
{{< / highlight >}}
